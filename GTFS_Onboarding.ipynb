    "The [MBTA’s GTFS Feed](https://github.com/mbta/gtfs-documentation/blob/master/reference/gtfs.md) consists of a series of [text files in a standard format](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference) that represent the system’s static schedule (along with other geographic information). This data ultimately underlies the schedule data available through the [MBTA's V3 API](https://www.mbta.com/developers/v3-api), and is referenced by data included in our [GTFS-realtime](https://www.mbta.com/developers/gtfs-realtime) feeds (not covered in this guide).\n",

    "Throughout this guide, you will gain familiarity with the data tables included in the feed, organized by their corresponding API resources. For the purposes of this guide, we will be using the GTFS Feed active on [October 14, 2020](https://cdn.mbta.com/archive/archived_feeds.txt).\n",

    "* [Services](#Services): A set of dates on which trips run for one or more routes\n",

    "* [Route Patterns](#Route-Patterns): Subsets of a route, representing different possible patterns of where trips may serve\n",
